# Introduction to Apache Airflow: Automating and Managing Workflows

## Introduction  
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. In today’s data-driven world, automating complex processes—such as data pipelines, machine learning model training, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks—is critical for efficiency and scalability. Airflow allows teams to define workflows as code, making them reusable, dynamic, and easily maintainable. Whether orchestrating daily data ingestion or coordinating multi-team workflows, Airflow provides the tools to ensure tasks run in the right order, at the right time, and with proper monitoring.

## Learning Objectives  
1. **Understand** the core components of Apache Airflow, including DAGs, Operators, and Tasks.  
2. **Design** a basic workflow using Airflow’s Python-based framework.  
3. **Monitor** and troubleshoot workflows using Airflow’s UI and logging features.

## What is a Workflow?  
A workflow is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order to achieve a goal. In data engineering, workflows might include steps like fetching data, cleaning it, analyzing it, and generating reports. Manually managing these processes is error-prone and inefficient. Apache Airflow solves this by allowing you to define workflows as code, automating their execution and monitoring.

## Core Components of Apache Airflow  

### 1. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)  
- **Core Idea**: A DAG defines the workflow structure, representing tasks and their dependencies. It ensures tasks run in the correct order without cycles.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Written in Python, making it dynamic and flexible.  
  - Scheduled using cron-like syntax or time intervals.  
  - Enables task reuse and modularity.  

**Example DAG Definition**:
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def extract_data():
    print("Extracting data...")

with DAG(
    "example_etl",
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval="@daily"
) as dag:
    extract = PythonOperator(
        task_id="extract",
        python_callable=extract_data
    )
